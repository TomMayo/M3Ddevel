Description: (This package serves as development for the M3D Bioconductor package) This package identifies statistically significantly differentially
    methylated regions of CpGs. It uses kernel methods (the Maximum Mean
    Discrepancy) to measure differences in methylation profiles, and relates
    these to inter-replicate changes, whilst accounting for variation in
    coverage profiles.
